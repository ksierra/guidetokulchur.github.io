Founded in 2013 by RA Washington, GTK Creative's aim is to publish stories and poems that make us think about who we are, our community, the world, and our place in it. Since the beginning, GTK Creative has been home to emerging and marginalized voices and a place for writers and readers to come together in appreciation and celebration of each other.

Each issue is curated and edited by Krystal Sierra and printed quarterly in limited, perfect-bound, hand-crafted editions of 300 by Guide To Kulchur Press in the Historic Detroit Shoreway Neighborhood of Cleveland, Ohio.
